## To examine the fairness and accuracy of commercial and industrial property assessments under Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios, ProPublica Illinois and the Chicago Tribune conducted three separate analyses:

- An examination of unchanged assessor’s initial valuations over multiple reassessment periods. Methodology for this analysis is [here.](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/the-tax-divide-analysis#first-pass-assessment-analysis) Analysis code can be found in the [`first-pass.R`](https://github.com/propublica/propertyasessments/blob/master/first-pass.R) 

- A sales ratio study comparing the assessor’s valuations to actual sales prices. Methodology for this analysis is [here.](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/the-tax-divide-analysis#sales-ratio-studies-2011-2015) Analysis code can be found in the [`sales-ratio-study.R`](https://github.com/propublica/propertyasessments/blob/master/sales-ratio-study.R)

- A look at appeals of commercial and industrial assessments in Cook County. Methodology for this analysis is [here.](https://projects.propublica.org/graphics/the-tax-divide-analysis#appeals-analysis) Analysis code can be found in the [`appeals-analysis.R`](https://github.com/propublica/propertyasessments/blob/master/appeals-analysis.R)
